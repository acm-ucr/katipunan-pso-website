      "'Till the Sun Rises' follows Nina Valenzuela's journey through adolescent depression. After running away, she is brought back home by her sister, Bea, the eldest of three. Her parents, Edrick and Rose, fear losing her again and strive to support her. As the Valenzuela family navigates Nina's situation, other family issues resurface, including Bea's post-college gap year and neglect toward the youngest child, Gabriel. While Nina has friendships for support, she struggles to mend her relationship with her parents and find personal growth. This play explores themes of internal healing, generational gaps, destigmatizing mental health (specifically depression) in Filipino-American families, and family dynamics.",
