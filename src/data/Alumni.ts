      "My name is Kristine Plena and I graduated in the class of 2021 with a BA in Media & Cultural Studies. It was a journey for me to get to the position that I have now. I initially wanted to go into the marketing field, but throughout my fourth year, I was working with a lot of virtual events—both within the organizations I was a part of and with the internship I had at the time. From there I realized working these events and behind the scenes work was something I truly excelled in. The transition of in-person to virtual was a challenge, but it made me realize that I loved creating meaningful events/moments and yearned to create in-person events once again. A year after I graduated, I was lucky enough to land a job as an event coordinator for Silicon Valley Bank. Before landing this job, I was constantly applying to jobs—to the point where my best friend and I had competitions on who would apply to the most. After a few months with this position, I hope to gain more experience and knowledge within the event management field. Even though I’ve only been in this position for a few months, the mentors I have and the challenges I’ve faced make me extremely grateful to have this amazing opportunity. I hope to one day work as the event manager/coordinator for multiple non profits around the world. Back to when I was in webppunan, I had the honor of being social chair my 2nd year and internal Vice President my last year. Both positions are primary factors as to why I pursued a career in the event management field. webppunan not only became my home away from home, but it became the place that had helped me grow tremendously throughout my 4 years at UCR. There are too many memories to recount that hold a place in my heart, but one of the top moments is my first friendship games, which also happened to be the one I was in charge of too. The years flash by you in the blink of an eye, but what you gain from that experience is long lasting. When your 4th year comes around—obviously focus on your studies, your internships, your jobs—but go to every webp event. Participate in every webp event, experience, games, open mic. Enjoy those to the full extent, go all out. Enjoy all that is webp. After graduation, focus on yourself, on your career, on your passions, and just put your best foot forward in life. The journey is never easy, but your hard work will pay off.",

      "Hi webppunan! While I was mainly active the years before the pandemic, I am forever grateful for my time in it as it impacted my college experience heavily. Most notably, being a part of Tinikling during the Love Lost year and Cabinet 2019-2020 as Public Relations Chairperson. The lessons I learned from both experiences I carry with me today: take a chance on myself and see how far I can go. I had never danced, nor had PR experience, but that is what college is about, trying new things. Since then, that lesson has given me the courage to take on so many new opportunities within college: being a physical therapist intern, joining a sorority (go GPhi!), playing flag football IMs, club volleyball, working multiple different jobs, and deciding to switch career paths away from the healthcare field. All of which I would have never thought of as a timid first year.Currently, I am working as an administrative assistant under the fundraising team for a non-profit in San Diego where I am able to give back to the homeless community. It has been so fulfilling being able to create change for the city where I have lived in my whole life. While I initially thought that I would be preparing to go to Physician Assistant school in my gap year, I am so relieved I made the decision to switch my path as a fourth year. I am excited to hopefully be attending an MBA program this fall to further cultivate my journey in business. I hope that one day I am able to work in the sports industry as I have always had a passion playing different sports my whole life. I hope you all are enjoying webp! Reach out to me on linkedin or insta! Put effort into webp and watch it love you back. - Coco/Nica linkedin.com/in/nicoleragadio/ ; @ncocopuffs",

      "Hello webppuneros!My name is Jamielene Sera and I graduated in 2022 with a B.S. in Neuroscience. My college career started at CSU San Marcos where I quickly learned how unprepared I was to face the world. After only a year, I moved back home and finished my general education courses at Grossmont Community College where I earned an A.S. in both Biology and Psychology. In 2020, I transferred to UCR as a Neuroscience major and found a home away from home within webppunan. I joined webppunan during the pandemic where I attended the first general meeting on Zoom. I still remember the icebreaker game where we raced to find common Filipino household objects (walis, tsinelas, and rice cooker). It was chaotic, fun, and reminiscent of how me and my cousins acted when we were young. I knew in that moment I wanted to be more involved.I was an apprentice my first year in webppunan where I had the pleasure of working alongside cabinet members to plan and coordinate webppunan events. Later on, I became Apprentice Advisor and participated in PACN as a dancer on the Tinikling team. webppunan will always have a special place in my heart and is something I am grateful for everyday because it: 1. Helped me find a community eager to learn, share, and advocate Filipino culture 2. Introduced me to lifelong friends who let me be ... me 3. Made me realize I already had everything I needed to succeed within me .Fast forward to the present, I work 12-hour shifts three days a week as a Medical Assistant in Urgent Care. On my days off, I like to read, visit coffee shops to find the best iced chai latte, and play tourist in my own city. I’m going back to school at the end of January to finish a few prerequisite courses so I can apply to Physician Assistant (PA) school this year. Some days are hard while others are just plain rough. I’m still far from where I want to be, but I’m closer than I was a year ago, even a month ago. Sometimes I beat myself up for being at this stage so “late” in my life but then I think about how scared, lonely, and doubtful 19 year old Jamielene was. I don’t know who I would’ve been if I didn’t take the risks I did but I imagine I wouldn’t feel as secure and stable as I do now. 19 year old Jamielene would’ve been so proud to know that the girl who was scared of failure learned to brush the dust off and keep going. If you know me you’ve probably heard my all time favorite quote countless times, but here it is again: “Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will”. So silence your doubts and give yourself the opportunity you deserve. The only thing standing between you and that goal is you. Please feel free to contact me about anything (webppunan, Urgent Care / PA, book recommendations) literally anything (: instagram: @jamielene",

      "Hi everyone! My name is Christian Paraiso. I graduated in 2021 with a degree in psychology. Funny enough, I got a job in biotech a few months after graduating and have been a lab assistant in a next-generation sequencing lab ever since. Although I was very interested in psychology as a career, I found myself looking towards user interface/user experience after graduating. While I did end up in a really nice bio-tech job, I will be planning to change career paths and start looking towards user interface and user experience! Since I started working full time, I began to really miss my time at UCR. I joined webppunan during my second year and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Although I was not the most active and was also very shy, it was here that I found a home away from home! Getting picked up by my ate and kuya and meeting the rest of my fam was an experience I’ll never forget. This also helped me put myself out there and strive to be more social. One of my favorite memories during my time in webp was actually being a part of the stage crew for PACN in 2019! Helping set up the stage and transitions, as well as being a volunteer whiteboard holder, was incredibly fun. Seeing the culmination of everybody’s efforts to put together Love Lost was an experience I will never forget. And although I always wished I was more active in webp, I am still thankful for the people I’ve met and the memories I’ve made because they helped make my college experience amazing. If I had any advice for anyone in webp, it would be to just take the leap. Don’t wait around for something to happen, take some action. Go to that social, try out for groundhog at friendship games, audition for a role for PACN. These are things I wish I did more, and I promise you it will be worth it!

      "Hi everyone, my name is Emily! I graduated in 2021 with a B.S. in Cellular, Molecular, and Developmental Biology. I’m entering my 2nd year of optometry school at the Illinois College of Optometry in Chicago, Illinois! I joined webp in 2017 and remained fairly active until my 4th year! I wouldn’t change my experience in webp for anything. I grew up somewhat isolated from Filipino culture, so entering college I was searching for a community that could influence me for the better. Luckily, I didn’t have to search far because webp accepted me so quickly. The people I met through webp were so welcoming and I’m proud to say that some of my closest friends to this day I met through webp! I participated in Stage Crew for PACN all 4 years. My favorite memory was joking around backstage with members of stage crew. We would be laughing so hard that we would nearly miss our cues to switch scenes. PACN practices quickly became the highlights of my day. I think that’s one of the best parts of webp: school is challenging, but with my friends I could forget about my responsibilities for a quick 4 hours. I always knew PACN practice would have me smiling and surrounded by my favorite people. I enjoyed it so much that I became Stage Crew Manager my 4th year. Even though we didn’t have a stage for “Too Good To Say Goodbye” in 2021, it was an honor to work alongside my friends. My advice for current members is to savor the moment! Organizations like webppunan are truly special & are hard to find. Trust me, I’m forever thankful for the opportunities and friendships webp offered me. Take advantage of it! With love from Chicago, Emily Chong P.s. if you’re interested in pursuing optometry or hearing about my optometric journey, don’t hesitate to reach out! My instagram is @emily_ _chong :)",

      "Hello, webppuneros! My name is Joelyn “Joe” Valencia and I graduated in June 2021 with a B.S. in Bioengineering. The first two years of college I definitely struggled with loneliness and finding a place where I belonged. I was unbelievably hard on myself when it came to school. For the first two years, all I would really do was go to class, the gym, and back to my dorm or the library to study. The only people I ever talked to were the people in my learning community, and while I can’t thank them enough for everything, I was still searching for a sense of community and those deeper connections. After mustering up all my courage, I joined webppunan late into my second year and was immediately met with welcoming arms. webppunan helped me find the balance I needed to succeed in my academic life, maintain a happy social life, and grow closer to my culture. The friendships and support system I gained in webppunan not only gave me the confidence and drive to succeed, but provided me a safe place that I could call home. The challenges that come after graduation are unpredictable, yet extremely valuable. A few months after graduation, I moved to Daly City to work at a startup biotech company as a Field Service and Hardware Support Engineer. The best way I can describe my current role is to travel to customer sites to install and repair the company’s instrument, and to test and design new features for the instrument. I achieved everything I could’ve asked for, yet I still had the same sense of loneliness as first and second year Joe. I had lost my sense of balance. Friends that were once a quick 5 minute drive turned into a 7 hour drive. I constantly overworked myself - I could count a handful of days where I started the day at 8 AM and returned home at 7:00 PM. I was hard on myself whenever I made a mistake at work. I fell into the repeated cycle of work, gym, and sleep. I would think about work 24/7 and would feel completely lost when I wasn’t working.  Thankfully, I regained my sense of balance by building a support system in the Bay Area with other webppunan alumni. They constantly reminded me to make time for the things I enjoy. Whether it be discovering a new restaurant, seeing your favorite artist, playing with your dog, or journaling, taking time for the things you love lets you appreciate all the hardships and daily struggles. Making time for the things you enjoy relieves stress and allows you to discover deeper parts of yourself. Second, they reminded me that there is always someone cheering you on, near and far. Those that love and support you will do what they can to make you feel that. Those that love and support you will always make you feel like you belong and you’re at home. The right support system won’t let you go through hardships alone. With that being said, I hope you find a support system that gives you the courage to push through each obstacle. I hope you one day find that place where you can breathe, and feel like you finally belong. I hope you make time for the things you enjoy. I hope you find that balance so you can succeed. ",

      "Those that know me have seen how much a blessing webppunan has been for me from the moment I walked into the AI Knoll for Meet and Greet, to the time I put on my cap and gown at graduation ceremony. I can say, without a doubt, that webppunan has blessed me with the idea of community. Nowhere else in life have I found a group of people so tightly bonded and willing to help before joining webppunan in 2017. It actually first took me by surprise how well this group of college students treated each other- they gladly offered rides, helped with class, and listened when you wanted your voice heard… back where I was from, this was a rare find. As an eager college student with this new supportive environment, I took the ground running. webppunan gave me the brightest role models, the most inspirational of friends, and a loving AKA family to give me the strength it took to establish my personality, career, and confidence. I was finding direction within my dental path, unbreakable self love, and a devotion to mentorship through these people. Now at NYU College of Dentistry, the lessons learned from webppunan continue to stay with me. I know which qualities make a group of people thrive and succeed in an educational setting. I understand the importance of support in each environment you find yourself in. And I know how to pay it forward when it comes to finding knowledge and success in life. Super excited to witness the many more transformations this organization has yet to see!!",

      "Take a deep breath real quick... Okay, ready? Repeat after me: 'Patience, and my time will come.' Then, say it again. 'Patience, and my time will come.' It's funny. I thought I was gonna be off to the races after graduating: working, building a career, paying off my loans, doing taxes and what not, just 'adult things' my parents and other elders would tell me throughout my education. I mean, sure, even after half a year out of college I started to experience these kinds of financial hurdles myself (along with other people). But to be honest, after 18 years of education, it feels like I'm only just about at the start of the race. The race I'm referring to isn't for renowned success, financial stability, fame, or even the network you build. I'm referring to the race to find yourself, and I mean REALLY finding yourself. Aside from the money, the success, the career, and who you know, who are YOU, really? Why do we rely on those four aspects heavily to define who we are? Why do we act with more urgency to achieve temporary fulfillment? Why do we compete with each other for those things? The race isn't even a race because at the end of the day, we all have our own start and finish lines. We all have our own challenges and privileges. Why let someone else dictate what you want to do or how you want to do it, if they haven't been in your shoes? I may not have as much life experience as other alumni, but I do feel like a lot has been learned in this turbulent year about believing in the person I am, especially with surmounted self-doubt here and there. And that learning doesn't stop. At 23, there's still soooo much life ahead, I'm just barely scratching at the surface of my potential. It's a marathon, always has been. It's not up to me or anyone else to tell you what to do, but I encourage y'all to Be Patient, Trust, and get to Know Yourself. You will arrive where you want to be, eventually, when it's your time to get there. You'll know when it's your time too, because the energy never lies. You're capable of more than you think when you get out of your own way. BIO: Allen was born and raised in Parañaque City, Philippines, before immigrating to California.

      "I’ll admit, nothing will ever fully prepare you for life after college. The most difficult part for me was suddenly not being with the people I was so used to seeing every day. Moving back to the bay area and being 400+ miles away from my best friends & boyfriend was heartbreaking enough, but also having to worry about job applications, interviews, and taking a pre-req class for grad school was overwhelming to say the least. I eventually landed a job at a Fortune 500 biotech company and I should’ve been proud of myself, but to be honest, I wasn’t. It didn’t feel like a right fit for me and I was unhappy there, but I stayed because I thought it’d be a dumb choice to leave such a good company straight after college, and it would look good on resumes and applications. I was able to toughen it out the first few months by balancing my time between working on weekdays, and then spending a lot of my weekends taking flights to Riverside to visit my friends. It was bearable. But then... Covid happened. Our lives and the world around us changed in an instant and everything we took for granted was suddenly stripped from us. I suddenly wasn’t able to take much needed breaks in Riverside anymore, and instead was stuck spending 8 hours a day in a place I hated and then going straight home. I felt stuck and hopeless, and it took a toll on my mental health. Constantly seeing the number of covid cases rise and being so unhappy with my present life was a huge wakeup call for me because it made me realize that life is too short & unpredictable to not be spending it doing something that makes you happy. So, I ended up leaving my job, because if anything in life makes you unhappy or doesn’t feel right, whether it’s a job, relationship, or friendship, do yourself a favor and leave. I’ve been focusing on myself and spending more time at home with my grandma, my parents, and my dog. I also went to see a psychiatrist, which helped me immensely (if you also struggle with mental health issues, please please get help & always remember that you are never alone)! I’ve spent a majority of my life always planning my next step and thinking of the future that I forgot to simply just live in the present. Although it’s important to plan ahead, with the future so unpredictable, it’s more important than ever to enjoy life right now. Spread love and gratitude (and not germs)! Every day you wake up is a blessing. Make sure to spend time with people you care about (safely, of course, we’re still in a pandemic) and don’t forget to tell them you love them & appreciate them. Because if this year taught us anything, it’s that tomorrow is never guaranteed. I’m especially grateful for all the wonderful people I met through webppunan- my kuya, ate, boyfriend, sibs, adings, grands, ggs, etc… Despite the distance, they are always cheering me on & supporting me from afar, and whenever I do get to spend time with them, they make me feel like I never left. And that’s the beauty of having been in such a tight-knit org, even though we’re all technically not in webp anymore, we’ll always and forever be family.

      "Online teaching sucks. I’m not sure I’m supposed to say that, but I’ve always said I’d keep it real with my webppunan family. So, this is me, keeping it real with you. I have been an educator for 15 years. I have seen a lot, and experienced so many changes in the time I’ve been in the classroom. Educators are made of resilient stock, and we thrive in pressure situations. That’s part of the fun! Students and classrooms are unpredictable, in the best way. A global pandemic is not something I ever actually imagined, but here we are. Publishing my entire curriculum online has been a challenge. Teaching my classes and my own eight-year-old son at home has been hard. I miss seeing my students in person. My favorite thing about teaching is the connection I get to make with students. To see them learning, inquiring, laughing, debating, even fighting to stay awake… it is all part of sharing minutes and hours with each other. The learning experience is so powerful, and I miss it. I am, however, so grateful to see faces on Zoom. It’s not where I want to be, but I’m glad I’m able to see students’ faces, even if it is virtually. I am grateful to see them because I worry about their social emotional wellness. I worry about their home lives. I worry about their access to education. I worry that they don’t know how much I care about them. I worry about THEM. So it is with this energy, I strive to encourage each of you. I encourage you all to stay committed to your education. We, your teachers/professors/instructors, are doing our best because we believe in YOU. We believe in the power of education, and we believe we are in this together. Stay committed to the highest possible vision you’ve created for your life. As we live out the legacy of our grandparents and parents, we must work to stay the course, even with the chaos around us. Whenever I start to feel discouraged or defeated, I think of the rich history of my own family. My Lola Paz was one of the first Asian women to be admitted to a graduate program at UCLA. She blazed this trail fearlessly, and proudly, so that I may follow her example. webp paths have been cleared for you to create your course? As we move into a month long celebration of our peoples’ history, perhaps we may reflect on whose legacy we honor, and the legacy we seek to create. We are in a virtual and literal storm, but we must stay strong. Your teachers have your back. Your fellow webppuneros have your back. I have your back. Together we learn, we struggle, we love, we grow. Makibaka. Huwag matakot. BIO: Marissa was a member and Political Chair for webppunan from 2001-2002.

      "Let me take you back to 2000. I recall the day I attended the UCR hosted Block Party searching for anything that would remind me of something familiar as I transitioned into college life. As I wove in and out of the crowd, I eventually found my way to the table of what was known back then as the Filipino Student Union (FSU). Attempting to avoid eye contact I timidly attempted to walk past the table and instead found myself immediately welcomed by a bright-eyed, cheerful Filipina whose smile seemed to reach the corners of her warm inviting eyes. The corners of our eyes creased with joy as we came to realize that we were both Bay Area natives. Her warmth extended a familiar feeling of home and immediately I felt less alone. This woman, Daisy Belle Morales Visitacion, would later become my Ate in the Ate/Kuya program and I would follow in her footsteps to serve as External Vice-President and President of webppunan. Daisy was not only my Ate throughout college. She continues to be both a friend and mentor to me in my personal and professional pursuits. Through Ate Daisy, I was able to meet so many fellow alum who had graduated before me and as a result have expanded the network of people I can tap into for guidance and support. I am a firm believer that the people we meet are meant to teach us something about ourselves, life or about the journey that we are on. Sometimes the realization of what the purpose of the friendship or meeting happens immediately, and sometimes it comes to surface at a later time. I am grateful for the bonds that I have been able to create through webppunan with members I have met and with those I have yet to meet. webp I mean is that without knowing it, my membership to webppunan immediately gave me a pass to access the vast network and family of Ate’s, Kuya’s and adings, some who I already know and some who I have yet to meet.My college experience was enhanced by joining webppunan as both member and officer. It was a place where I was able to re-discover my voice, further develop my leadership style, make mistakes and be forgiven, fail gracefully and have a community pick me up to start over again. It was a space where I was able to share in the success of our organization’s impact at UCR and in the greater community. I practiced amplifying not only my voice but also the voices of our community both on campus and off campus. I was able to explore the various political and social issues that impacted our community and raise them through different mediums. As Cultural Chair I had the opportunity to highlight the impact of domestic and dating violence in the Filipin@ and Filipin@ American community breathing life to the stories and experiences of some of our webppunan members, myself included. webppunan became a space of learning about myself, our Filipin@ American community and history, and a space I would call family; a space that contributed to even my own healing journey. The webppunan experience has provided me with a lifeline, a network of people to tap into for support and guidance. It has equipped me with tools to architect the work that I am doing now in Legal Operations designing, developing and enhancing systems and processes around products and emerging services, contributing to transformational change projects and in making an impact in the diversity, equality and inclusion space at my company. Embrace the relationships that you create through webppunan, be present and don’t be afraid to reach out. Community is everything. As we head into Alumni Conference this weekend, I hope you are encouraged to participate and learn from the amazing network of webppunan Alum who plan to impart kernels of wisdom about their journey from webppunan to the life they have designed.

As an alum, I am currently a Mentor for UCR Collection, Brand Ambassador for Goli, Nutrition Coach, Staff Accountant, and CEO of a small business.My goal when I joined webppunan PSO was to bridge a connection between Filipino-American businesses and KATI to emphasize our Cultural and Community Pillars. With that, I introduced the relationship with Seafood City and other allied businesses to give opportunities for KATI to grow. It has been something I’ve been most proud of and I truly hope it continues to develop in future generations of KATI. My time in KATI was the most challenging yet rewarding experience that shaped me to be the woman I am today and I continue to implement these values in my everyday life. For those still in school, these are the most crucial years of learning and growing so take every opportunity with gratitude and don’t let anyone dim your light. Online learning has been an adjustment but I hope you continue to have the motivation to pursue your degree. These college years will fly by and you will miss how “easy” things were. For the Class of 2021, Congratulations on almost completing a full year of online learning and earning your degree. As someone who entered post-grad life, it has been a rough transition. Not only we didn’t get the proper “goodbye” or have the same opportunities as previous graduating classes but also we’re experiencing postgrad during a pandemic. Even though life does not go as planned, you are in control of what you want to achieve in life. With your degree you will be in the next chapter of pursuing goals, challenging yourself, and creating new experiences. Due to the competitive job market, I continued my education, earned a certification as a Nutrition Coach, and took classes for an accounting program at UCSD. To earn extra income, I filed for a small business: Nourish by Deni. My advice for everyone is to reach out to alumni or mentors for potential connections on how you can advance your career. Some advice for you all is to save money, invest in stocks, keep learning (Masters, Med School, Coursera, Google Certificates, UC Extension), and gain experience (internships). Be open to change and take things at your own pace. We are all on unique journeys so there is no reason to compare our accomplishments, struggles, failures with one another but only with ourselves. I hope your support system inspires you to challenge yourself in some way. To be the person we aspire to be we must take chances and create an abundance of opportunities.Maraming salamat para sa lahat. Take Care.

      " College was many firsts for me and I’m sure I can say the same for a majority of you. Whether it be the first time we moved away to a new city or the first time we were going to have to make decisions as an adult, we can all agree that college is truly more than just an educational experience. I realize now that college was a safe space to truly create, shape, and grow into who and what you want to be. While I could go on and on about all my experiences, the most important thing I wanted to share is also one of the most cliche: It’s not about the destination, it’s about the journey. I say this because I personally did not fully realize that until I graduated. I can remember many times throughout undergrad where I’d often be stressing about whether or not I was making the right choice by joining organizations or wondering if something was worth my time. Looking back, I can see how everything I chose to do definitely contributed to where I am today because it gave me experiences to take on the real world. After college, I took some time off before pursuing more education. I worked with Alzheimer’s and Dementia patients for a while and after that, I worked in administration for a medical clinic. The takeaway from those jobs that amazed me the most was that while my education did help me in some ways, the reason I was confident enough to know I could handle anything that came my way or eventually learn how to, was because of my college experience. I’m talking about teamwork, working under pressure, connecting with your coworkers, thinking on your feet when there’s an emergency, accepting and learning from your mistakes, and so much more. I am so grateful that in some way, shape, or form, I experienced similar situations in college, especially webppunan! The last thing I wanted to share is powerful advice that I learned recently due to COVID-19. This pandemic has been hard for my family. Not only had my mother been diagnosed with cancer, but I also lost some loved ones, lost people in my life, and honestly, I even lost myself. However, I remember sitting in my backyard sharing about how miserable I felt with one of my cousins and he told me something I’d never, ever forget: “Pay attention to the people God is putting in your lane right now.” webp he meant by that was, sometimes we expect certain people in our lives to be there for us when times are hard, especially now. However, the people right now who are effortlessly and selflessly being there for you, celebrating you, and cherishing your very existence are the people you should recognize more than the people who you had hoped would be there for you. Don’t beat yourself up if you feel alone during this time. I promise you, the universe will provide you with loved ones if you take a step back and look around to find those who have been there the entire time. ll that being said, instead of worrying too much about whether or not you’re doing the right thing by investing in this or that, I say put all of that energy into making sure you get everything you want from that experience and more! Don’t let anyone or anything make you doubt that where you are right now is not where you’re supposed to be. Use all the gifts and talents you were given to keep exploring more and more about yourself. Not only will you surprise yourself, but you’ll find that everything you did, big or small, will benefit you and serve as powerful tools that will take you so far once you begin life after college.BIO: I joined webppunan my second year of college. I was the lead for PCN in 2017 and Cultural Chair for 2018. I graduated in 2018 in Biology. I previously worked at a facility for Alzheimer and Dementia patients. Currently I work in administration for a medical clinic and am attending nursing school. I enjoy writing, cooking, and being active outdoors. I hope everyone is taking the time to be gentle with themselves and keep their loved ones close. Email - davidjosephdellica@gmail.com IG - davidviday ",

      "Despite being the student body president during my senior year of high school, I felt small and inconsequential at the start of my freshman year. webppunan helped ease the shock of being a very small fish in a big ocean. Simply participating as a cast member in the 1993 PCN production gave me an opportunity to meet many new people and helped make UCR feel less vast and distant. I joined webppunan all four years and performed in all 4 PCN productions. Most of my college friendships were with webppunan members. Those friendships made college fun and rewarding. webppunan was a positive influence in my college career and I considered webppunan my extended family. My favorite outstanding  memory of my webppunan family, is waking up one morning alone after a group of us pulled an all nighter. After washing my face, I realized my fingernails and toenails were painted with black nail polish! I served as the Sports Coordinator my Junior year and a member of the executive cabinet my senior year. Serving in the leadership roles with webppunan provided an opportunity to further develop my interpersonal and communication skills and also fostered a higher confidence in myself, which I did not possess in high school. These skills and self confidence served me well in my graduate studies and subsequent career as a physician. I would offer as a pearl of wisdom to consider that a college education has far more important goals than academic mastery. These higher goals include: 1) knowing who you are; 2) learning how to relate and communicate with others as adults; 3) learning to think independently and critically. If you master these three, you are well equipped to accomplish whatever goals you may pursue. Contact Information EMAIL:  docmangoba@sbcglobal.net",
